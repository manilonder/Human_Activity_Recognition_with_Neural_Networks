# Human_Activity_Recognition_with_Neural_Networks
In this subject, we'll look at categorizing human activity using movement signals captured by three sensors concurrently (downstairs = 1, jogging = 2, sitting = 3, standing = 4, upstairs = 5, walking = 6). Time series of training and testing data (trX and tstX) and their accompanying labels are contained in the file data3.h5 (trY and tstY). Each time series has a length of 150 units. There are 3000 samples in the training set and 600 samples in the test set. To address a multi-class time series classification problem, you will design basic recurrent neural network architectures that were trained with back propagation through time.
